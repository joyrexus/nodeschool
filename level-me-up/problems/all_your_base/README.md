# ALL YOUR BASE

To get into the rhythm, let's do a simple *hello world*.

Write a Node program that accepts two command-line arguments, X and
Y and prints out to the console the following text:

  ALL YOUR *X* ARE BELONG TO *Y*

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  levelmeup run program.js

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  levelmeup verify program.js

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `levelmeup` again and select the next problem!
